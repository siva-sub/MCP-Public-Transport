# Singapore Location Intelligence MCP 🇸🇬

[![CI/CD](https://github.com/siva-sub/MCP-Public-Transport/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/siva-sub/MCP-Public-Transport/actions) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@siva-sub/mcp-public-transport.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@siva-sub/mcp-public-transport) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

As the creator of this project, I, Siva (Sivasubramanian Ramanathan), developed this comprehensive Singapore Location Intelligence Platform to explore the capabilities of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). My goal was to test how MCP could be leveraged to help AI accurately plan routes, while also showcasing my ability to work with various APIs and my expertise in the technologies involved.

What began as an experiment with MCP integration evolved into a sophisticated, real-world application that demonstrates the power of this exciting new protocol to create tools that can rival commercial solutions. This platform provides enterprise-grade transport routing, postal code resolution, and location intelligence with Google Maps-level detailed navigation instructions, all optimized for Singapore's unique transport ecosystem.

```
INPUT: "How to get to Suntec City from Little India MRT during heavy rain?"

OUTPUT: 
✅ Postal Code 039594 → SUNTEC CITY
🌧️ Heavy rain detected - prefer covered routes
🚇 Route: DT Line (8 min) → Covered walkway (6 min)
