As the creator of this project, I, Siva (Sivasubramanian Ramanathan), developed this comprehensive Singapore Location Intelligence Platform to explore the capabilities of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). My goal was to test how MCP could be leveraged to help AI accurately plan routes, while also showcasing my ability to work with various APIs and my expertise in the technologies involved.

What began as an experiment with MCP integration evolved into a sophisticated, real-world application that demonstrates the power of this exciting new protocol to create tools that can rival commercial solutions. This platform provides enterprise-grade transport routing, postal code resolution, and location intelligence with Google Maps-level detailed navigation instructions, all optimized for Singapore's unique transport ecosystem.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🎯 **Advanced Postal Code Intelligence** - 95% accuracy resolution for all Singapore postal codes
- 🗺️ **Professional Navigation Instructions** - Turn-by-turn directions like "Turn Left To Stay On Thomson Road"
- 🚇 **Multi-Modal Transport Planning** - Seamless integration of MRT, LRT, buses, and walking
- ⏰ **Singapore Time Intelligence** - Business hours, rush hour detection, and timing optimization
- 🔍 **Intelligent Location Search** - Fuzzy matching, typo tolerance, and smart suggestions
- 📍 **Comprehensive Geocoding** - Forward and reverse geocoding with Singapore-specific accuracy
- 🚌 **Real-Time Transport Data** - Live bus arrivals, train status, and service disruptions
- 💡 **Context-Aware Routing** - Peak hour optimization, last train warnings, night bus alternatives

## 🎯 Real-World Problem Solved

**Before**: Basic transport tools with failed postal code resolution
**After**: Enterprise-grade location intelligence platform

```
INPUT: "How to get to Suntec City from Little India MRT?"

OUTPUT: 
✅ Postal Code 039594 → SUNTEC CITY
🚇 Route: DT Line (8 min) → Walk (6 min) 
💰 Cost: $1.55 | 🕐 Duration: 29 minutes
📍 Step-by-step: "Walk 246m to ROCHOR MRT → Take DT Line from Rochor to Promenade → Walk 450m to destination"
```
